## Single Sign On

Users can sign into applications integrated with Pangea Passport.

It's like Google Sign On, but without having third party (Google) storing user data and authentication secrets

## Signatures

Turn the user's mobile phone into an authenticator with sovereign digital signatures.

Signatures are non-repudiate and show proof that the user and only the user signed it, and are associated to the app the signature was made in.

Sign:

* W3C Verifiable Credentials
* Package authentication to your server
* Documents (PDFs)
* Smart Contract Transactions
* Use provable Multi-factor authentication

## Sovereign Data Vault

Use Pangea Passport to store data (user-generated or not). This effectively turns Pangea Passport into a decentralized data storage system.

Apps can request verifiable data from other applications to speed up form-filling and onboarding processes.

## Peer-to-peer messaging

Send messages between users in your application, or even to users of other applications.

Easy to send.

Secure, private, end-to-end encrypted.
