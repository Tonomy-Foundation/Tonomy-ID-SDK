## Integration apps

Pangea API lets you connect your apps to Pangea Passport in the following ways:

* Desktop web: Displays a QR code for users to scan with the Pangea Passport mobile app.
* Mobile browser: Pangea API generates a dynamic deep link that takes users straight to your app in the Pangea Passport mobile app.
* Mobile native: Pangea API generates a dynamic deep link that takes users straight to your app in the Pangea Passport mobile app. (only React Native mobile apps are supported through the javascript SDK)

## Pangea Passport

Pangea Passport is available on Android and iOS as native applications. It can be deployed as a white label product.

Support for browser extensions or web wallets can be done directly by using the Pangea SDK (see [Deploy a web wallet with the SDK](../run-tonomy-gov-os/deploy-wallet.md) for more details).
