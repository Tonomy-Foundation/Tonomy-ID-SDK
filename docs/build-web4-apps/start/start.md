# Start

The Pangea API allow existing applications to login and interact with Pangea identities. This is through a familiar [Single Sign-On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (SSO) flow like with oAuth 2.0 or OpenIdConnect.

**Integration is expected to take 10-30 minutes**

See a demo Reactjs website use SSO to log in with Pangea ID and sign data here:

* [Demo website](https://demo.pangea.web4.world/)

## Prerequisites

To integrate with Pangea ID, **you must already have a deployed Pangea ID network**.

* Use the Pangea ID Demo network to try out integrating for the first time (this tutorial will use the demo network).
* To deploy your own white-labelled Pangea ID identity system see [Deploy Pangea ID](../../run-tonomy-gov-os/deploy.md).
