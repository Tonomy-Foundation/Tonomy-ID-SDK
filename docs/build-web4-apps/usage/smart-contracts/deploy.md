# Deploy

Once your smart contract is developed and tested locally, it needs to be **deployed to Tonomy Blockchain**.

## Submit Deployment Request

At this stage, **only Tonomy Foundation can deploy contracts on Tonomy Blockchain**. We are working towards enabling **developer self-deployments** in the future.

**Submit the following details to the Tonomy Foundation via** [**Contact Us**](https://tonomy.io/contact-us) **or Discord:**

| Property                                             | Example         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [Registeded App](../../register-app.md) Account Name | ahe23hehbaz5    |
| Contract WASM File                                   | mycontract.wasm |
| Contract ABI File                                    | mycontract.abi  |

You can alternatively send us your contract c++ source files and the CDT version used to compile them.

Our team will **review and deploy your contract** on the Tonomy Testnet or Mainnet.
