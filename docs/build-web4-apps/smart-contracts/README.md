# Smart Contracts

Pangea enables **seamless signing and execution of smart contract transactions** directly from your app, powered by **Pangea Blockchain**, which is built on the **Antelope protocol** (used by EOS, Telos, WAX, etc.).

**Developers use C++ to write Pangea smart contracts**. These contracts are deployed to the **Pangea Blockchain**, and users sign transactions via the **Pangea ID wallet** using their **app-scoped keys**.

### Why Use Pangea Smart Contracts?

* **Frictionless transactions**: Enable **gasless 1-click transactions** for users.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (Optional)**: Secure high-value operations.
* **Trustless Execution**: User signatures are **non-repudiable** and tied to **app permissions**.

### Smart Contracts on Pangea Blockchain (Antelope Protocol)

Pangea Blockchain is built on the **Antelope protocol**, a high-performance, modular and upgradeable blockchain protocol framework designed for speed, scalability, and low latency.

Key properties:

* **0.5s block times** and **15,000+ transactions per second (TPS)**.
* **C++ smart contracts** for maximum performance and flexibility.
* **Permission system** that allows **apps to sign on behalf of users**.
