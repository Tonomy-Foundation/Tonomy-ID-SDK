# Build Web4 Apps

The Pangea SDK allow applications to log in and interact with Pangea identities. This is done through a familiar Single Sign-On (SSO) flow, like with oAuth 2.0 or OpenIdConnect.

**Integration is expected to take 10-30 minutes**

## Features

* **Single Sign-On 🔑:** Authenticate and login users via Pangea ID
* **1-Click Free Transactions ⚡:** Secure, instant, and gasless smart contract execution. Users don't even need to leave your apps.
* **Verifiable Credentials ✅:** Use W3C-compliant signed credentials for private, off-chain verifiable data
* **Server Authentication 🔐**: Verify users with your server without trusting a centralized third-party
* **Multichain Crypto🌐:** Manage multiple cryptos with Pangea ID
* **Multichain Web3 Transaction🌐:** Sign web3 transactions using WalletConnect or Anchor protocol
* **Passphrase Recovery 🔄**: Restore via username + 6-word passphrase
* **SDK languages🛠️:** JavaScript support for web, React Native, and Node.js
