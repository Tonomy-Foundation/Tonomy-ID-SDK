## Launch an App

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only Tonomy Foundation developers can do this currently
{% endhint %}

With the launch of Tonomy Build, developers will be able to create and self-manage their own Web4 Apps in a no-code UI. This is a planned feature we have designed but not started development, without a committed launch date.

### Configure app details

Set the app name, description and other details in the CLI command here:

[https://github.com/Tonomy-Foundation/Tonomy-ID-SDK/blob/development/src/cli/msig/newApp.ts](https://github.com/Tonomy-Foundation/Tonomy-ID-SDK/blob/development/src/cli/msig/newApp.ts)

```bash
yarn run build:cli
```

### Create a new msig proposal to deploy the app

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't forget to set the NODE\_ENV and SIGNER private key for your governance account
{% endhint %}

```bash
yarn run cli msig propose new-app fiddleart
```

Check that the proposal looks good then write it in the Discord [#governance-council](https://discord.gg/VZavQC7J) channel for approval.
