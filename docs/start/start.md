# Start

The Pangea API allow existing applications to login and interact with Pangea identities. This is through a familiar [Single Sign-On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single\_sign-on) (SSO) flow like with oAuth 2.0 or OpenIdConnect.

**Integration is expected to take 10-30 minutes**

See a demo Reactjs website use SSO to log in with Pangea Passport and sign data here:

## Prerequisites

To integrate with Pangea Passport, **you must already have a deployed Pangea Passport network**.

* Use the Pangea Passport Demo network to try out integrating for the first time (this tutorial will use the demo network).
* To deploy your own white-labelled Pangea Passport identity system see [Deploy Pangea Passport](../../guides/deploy/).
