# Start

The Tonomy API allow existing applications to login and interact with Tonomy identities. This is through a familiar [Single Sign-On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (SSO) flow like with oAuth 2.0 or OpenIdConnect.

**Integration with an existing Tonomy network for a new app is expected to take 10-30 minutes**

See a demo Reactjs website use SSO to log in with Tonomy ID and sign data here:

## Prerequisites

To integrate with Tonomy ID, you must already have a deployed Tonomy ID ecosystem.

- Use the Tonomy ID Demo network to try out integrating for the first time (this tutorial will use the demo network).
- To deploy your own white-labelled Tonomy ID identity system see [Deploy Tonomy ID](../../guides/deploy.md).
