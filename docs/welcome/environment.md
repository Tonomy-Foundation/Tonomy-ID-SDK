## Integration apps

Tonomy API lets you connect your apps to Tonomy ID in the following ways:

- Desktop web: Displays a QR code for users to scan with the Tonomy ID mobile app.
- Mobile browser: Tonomy API generates a dynamic deep link that takes users straight to your app in the Tonomy ID mobile app.
- Mobile native: Tonomy API generates a dynamic deep link that takes users straight to your app in the Tonomy ID mobile app. (only React Native mobile apps are supported through the javascript SDK)

## Tonomy ID

Tonomy ID is available on Android and iOS as native applications. It can be deployed as a white label product.

Support for browser extensions or web wallets can be done directly by using the Tonomy SDK (see [Deploy a web wallet with the SDK](../../guides/deploy_wallet.md) for more details).
