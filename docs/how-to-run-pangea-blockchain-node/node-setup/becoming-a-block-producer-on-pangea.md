# Becoming a Block Producer on Pangea

Pangea Blockchain is launched with a limited feature set to facilitate the LEOS token sale and United Cititizens Wallet. Using the upgradable architecture, we plan to iterate and move more and more toward the Pangea whitepaper plan.



During this phase, the blockchain is governed by the Tonomy Foundation, which includes who are the block producers. You can see the Pangea governance roadmap here:
